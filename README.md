# React Flashcards

React Flashcards is a web application that allows users to create, manage, and study flashcards to enhance their learning experience.

## Features

- Only one flashcard can be flipped at a time to reveal its answer, ensuring others remain on the question side.
- Demonstrates the two-way communication of state between the parent and child components, highlighting dynamic state management.
